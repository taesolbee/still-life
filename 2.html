Paul Cézanne, Still Life with Water Jug c.1892–3, Tate
  <p><h2><u>ART TERM</u></h2>
    One of the principal genres (subject types) of Western art - essentially,
    the subject matter of a still life painting or sculpture is anything that
    does not move or is dead. <br><br>
    Still life includes all kinds of man-made or natural objects, cut flowers,
    fruit, vegetables, fish, game, wine and so on. Still life can be a celebration
    of material pleasures such as food and wine, or often a warning of the ephemerality
    of these pleasures and of the brevity of human life (see <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/m/memento-mori" target="_blank">memento mori</a>).<br>
  In the hierarchy of genres (or subject types) for art established in the
  seventeenth century by the French Academy, still life was ranked at the bottom
  - fifth after history painting, portraiture, genre painting (scenes of everyday
  life) and landscape. Still life and landscape were considered lowly because they
  did not involve human subject matter.<br>
  In modern art simple still life arrangements have often been used as a relatively
  neutral basis for formal experiment, for example by Paul Cézanne, the cubist
  painters and, later in the twentieth century, by Patrick Caulfield. (C) TATE</p>
