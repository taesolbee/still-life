  <p><h2><u>MOVIE</u></h2>
  Life for the unassuming John May (Eddie Marsan Happy-Go-Lucky, "Ray Donovan")
  has always revolved around his work for the local council in South London,
  finding the next of kin of those who have died alone. Profoundly dedicated to
  his work, <strong>he believes that everyone deserves a <u>dignified exit</u></strong>,
  and writes eulogies and organizes funerals for those who wouldn't have
  them otherwise. But when a new case - an elderly alcoholic in a flat directly
  opposite his own - hits him harder than usual, he journeys outside London to
  track down the man's long-abandoned daughter (Joanne Froggatt "Downton Abbey").
  Against the odds, the two lonely souls are drawn to each other - and John's
  outlook starts to open to life's possibilities. (C) Tribeca</p>
